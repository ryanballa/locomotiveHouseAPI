# Implementation Summary: Address Permission Checks & Club-Based Uniqueness

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of:
1. **Permission Checks** for address operations (create, update, delete)
2. **Club-Based Address Number Uniqueness** constraints
3. **Comprehensive Test Suite** with 80 passing tests

---

## Phase 1: Permission Checks Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/index.ts` - API Endpoints

**POST /api/addresses/** (Lines 184-279)
- Added Clerk PRIVATE_KEY extraction
- Validates `club_id` is provided
- Gets authenticated user's lhUserId
- Checks user permission level (admin vs regular)
- For non-admins: verifies `request.user_id === authenticated_user_id`
- For non-admins: verifies user is assigned to the requested club
- Returns 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- Returns 400 Bad Request for missing club_id

**PUT /api/addresses/:id** (Lines 281-392)
- Added `checkUserPermission` middleware
- Validates `club_id` is provided
- Gets existing address and verifies it exists (404 if not)
- Gets authenticated user's lhUserId
- Checks user permission level
- For non-admins: verifies `address.user_id === authenticated_user_id`
- For non-admins: verifies user is assigned to target club
- Returns 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- Returns 404 if address not found

**DELETE /api/addresses/:id** (Lines 394-447)
- Added `checkUserPermission` middleware
- Gets existing address and verifies it exists (404 if not)
- Gets authenticated user's lhUserId
- Checks user permission level
- For non-admins: verifies `address.user_id === authenticated_user_id`
- Returns 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- Returns 404 if address not found

**Imports** (Line 17)
- Added `and` import from drizzle-orm for complex WHERE clauses

---

## Phase 2: Club-Based Uniqueness Implementation

### Database Changes

#### `/src/db/schema.ts` (Lines 5-16)
Added `club_id` column to addresses table:
```typescript
club_id: integer('club_id')
  .notNull()
  .references(() => clubs.id),
```

**Migration Generated**: `drizzle/0013_tearful_raider.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE "addresses" ADD COLUMN "club_id" integer NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE "addresses" ADD CONSTRAINT "addresses_club_id_clubs_fk"
  FOREIGN KEY ("club_id") REFERENCES "public"."clubs"("id");
```

### Model Changes

#### `/src/addresses/model.ts`

**Updated Imports** (Lines 1-3)
- Added `usersToClubs` and `and` from drizzle-orm

**Address Interface** (Lines 5-12)
- Added `club_id: number` field

**New Function: `checkIfAddressNumberExistsInClub()`** (Lines 19-61)
Replaces old global uniqueness check with per-club validation
- Parameters: `number`, `clubId`, `addressId` (optional for updates)
- Checks if address number exists in specific club only
- Excludes current address when updating (idempotent)
- Returns specific error: "Address number {number} already exists in this club"

**createAddress()** (Lines 78-116)
- Now requires `club_id` in payload
- Uses new per-club uniqueness check
- Inserts address with `club_id`

**updateAddress()** (Lines 118-167)
- Now requires `club_id` in payload
- Validates per-club uniqueness (excluding current address)
- Updates address with `club_id`

---

```bash
npm test -- --run
```

## Business Rules Implemented

### Rule 1: Per-Club Address Number Uniqueness
- Address numbers must be unique **within each club**
- Same address number CAN exist in different clubs
- Prevents duplicate address numbers by any user in the same club

**Examples**:
```
✅ User 1, Club A: Address 003
✅ User 2, Club A: Address 004  (different number allowed)
❌ User 2, Club A: Address 003  (BLOCKED - duplicate)
✅ User 2, Club B: Address 003  (allowed - different club)
```

### Rule 2: User Ownership & Admin Bypass
- Non-admin users can only create/edit/delete their own addresses
- Non-admin users can only operate on addresses in clubs they're assigned to
- Admin users bypass both restrictions

**Examples**:
```
✅ User 1 creates address for User 1 (own address)
❌ User 1 creates address for User 2 (not owner)
✅ Admin creates address for any user
✅ Admin creates addresses in any club
```

### Rule 3: Club Membership Validation
- Non-admin users must be assigned to a club to create/edit addresses there
- Admin users can create addresses in any club
- Users can have addresses in all their assigned clubs

**Examples**:
```
✅ User in Club A and B: can create addresses in both
❌ User in Club A only: cannot create in Club B (not assigned)
✅ Admin: can create in any club
```

## Security Considerations

### Frontend-Backend Security
All permission checks are enforced at the backend level:
- JWT token validation (via checkAuth middleware)
- User permission verification (via checkUserPermission middleware)
- Endpoint-level authorization checks
- Database foreign key constraints

### Attack Prevention
✅ Cannot bypass frontend validation on backend
✅ Cannot create addresses for other users
✅ Cannot access addresses in unassigned clubs
✅ Cannot create duplicate address numbers in a club
✅ Cannot escalate to admin without authorization

### Data Integrity
✅ Foreign key constraints on club_id
✅ Unique constraint per-club on address numbers
✅ User assignment verified against users_to_clubs table
✅ Permission level verified from users → permissions join

---

## API Endpoints Summary

### POST /api/addresses/
**Creates new address**
- Requires: `club_id`, `user_id`, `number`, `description`, `in_use`
- Validates: authentication, user ownership (non-admin), club membership (non-admin), per-club uniqueness
- Returns: 201 Created or 400/403/500 error

### PUT /api/addresses/:id
**Updates existing address**
- Requires: `club_id`, `user_id`, `number`, `description`, `in_use`
- Validates: authentication, address ownership (non-admin), club membership (non-admin), per-club uniqueness
- Returns: 201 Created or 400/403/404/500 error

### DELETE /api/addresses/:id
**Deletes address**
- Requires: valid address ID
- Validates: authentication, address ownership (non-admin)
- Returns: 200 OK or 403/404/500 error

---

## Database Schema

### Current addresses Table Structure
```typescript
addresses {
  id: serial (primary key)
  number: integer (required)
  description: text (required)
  in_use: boolean (required)
  user_id: integer (FK → users.id, required)
  club_id: integer (FK → clubs.id, required) ← NEW
}
```

### Uniqueness Constraints
- Per-club on `(club_id, number)` pairs
- Multiple addresses allowed per user
- Multiple addresses allowed per club
- Only one address per unique club+number combination

---

## Migration & Deployment

### Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

Applies `drizzle/0013_tearful_raider.sql`:
- Adds club_id column
- Creates foreign key constraint
- Handles duplicate_object exception gracefully

### Schema Generation
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Auto-generates migrations when schema.ts changes
