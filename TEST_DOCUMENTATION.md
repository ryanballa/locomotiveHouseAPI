# Address API Tests Documentation

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite for address creation, updating, and deletion with club-based unique constraints and authorization checks.

**Test Results: 80 tests passing** ✅

## Test Files

### 1. `test/addresses.model.test.ts` - Model Logic Tests
**17 tests** - Unit tests for address model functions with mocked database

#### Test Suites:

**createAddress**
- ✓ Rejects creation without required fields
- ✓ Rejects creation without club_id
- ✓ Rejects creation without user_id
- ✓ Rejects when address number already exists in club
- ✓ Allows same address number in different clubs
- ✓ Creates address with all required fields

**updateAddress**
- ✓ Rejects update without required fields
- ✓ Rejects update without club_id
- ✓ Rejects update without address ID
- ✓ Rejects when number conflicts with another address in same club
- ✓ Allows updating address to same number (idempotent)
- ✓ Updates address with new valid number in same club
- ✓ Allows changing club when number is unique in target club

**deleteAddress**
- ✓ Rejects deletion without address ID
- ✓ Deletes address successfully

**Per-Club Uniqueness Constraint**
- ✓ Prevents duplicate address numbers within same club
- ✓ Allows same address number in different clubs by same user

---

### 2. `test/addresses.endpoints.test.ts` - API Endpoint Tests
**35 tests** - Integration test specifications for all endpoints

#### POST /api/addresses/

**Authorization & Validation (5 tests)**
- ✓ Requires authentication
- ✓ Requires checkUserPermission middleware
- ✓ Rejects request without club_id
- ✓ Rejects if user_id doesn't match authenticated user (non-admin)
- ✓ Rejects if user not assigned to club (non-admin)

**Club-Based Uniqueness (3 tests)**
- ✓ Rejects duplicate address number in same club
- ✓ Allows same address number in different clubs
- ✓ Allows same address number by different users (blocked per club)

**Successful Creation (1 test)**
- ✓ Creates address with valid request

#### PUT /api/addresses/:id

**Authorization & Validation (7 tests)**
- ✓ Requires authentication
- ✓ Requires checkUserPermission middleware
- ✓ Returns 404 if address doesn't exist
- ✓ Rejects if user_id doesn't match address owner (non-admin)
- ✓ Rejects request without club_id
- ✓ Rejects if user not assigned to target club (non-admin)
- ✓ Allows admin to bypass club membership check

**Club-Based Uniqueness (4 tests)**
- ✓ Rejects number change that conflicts in same club
- ✓ Allows unchanged address number (idempotent)
- ✓ Allows moving address to different club with same number
- ✓ Allows changing number within same club if new number is available

**Successful Updates (2 tests)**
- ✓ Updates address description
- ✓ Updates address in_use status

#### DELETE /api/addresses/:id

**Authorization & Validation (5 tests)**
- ✓ Requires authentication
- ✓ Requires checkUserPermission middleware
- ✓ Returns 404 if address doesn't exist
- ✓ Rejects if user_id doesn't match address owner (non-admin)
- ✓ Allows admin to bypass ownership check

**Successful Deletion (1 test)**
- ✓ Deletes address successfully

#### Complex Multi-Club Scenarios (3 tests)
- ✓ User with 2 clubs can have same address number in each
- ✓ Prevents duplicate across all club scenarios
- ✓ Admin can manage addresses across multiple clubs

#### Error Scenarios (3 tests)
- ✓ Handles database errors gracefully
- ✓ Rejects invalid JSON in request body
- ✓ Handles concurrent requests safely

---

### 3. `test/addresses.auth.test.ts` - Authorization Tests
**28 tests** - Comprehensive authorization and club membership validation

#### User Type Permissions

**Admin Users (4 tests)**
- ✓ Can create addresses for any user in any club
- ✓ Can edit any address
- ✓ Can delete any address
- ✓ Bypasses club membership check

**Regular Users (6 tests)**
- ✓ Can only create addresses for themselves
- ✓ Cannot create addresses for other users
- ✓ Can only edit their own addresses
- ✓ Cannot edit addresses owned by others
- ✓ Can only delete their own addresses
- ✓ Cannot delete addresses owned by others

**Unauthenticated Users (3 tests)**
- ✓ Are rejected on POST /api/addresses/
- ✓ Are rejected on PUT /api/addresses/:id
- ✓ Are rejected on DELETE /api/addresses/:id

**Users Without lhUserId (1 test)**
- ✓ Are rejected due to missing checkUserPermission

#### Club Membership Validation

**User in Single Club (2 tests)**
- ✓ Can create addresses in their assigned club
- ✓ Cannot create addresses in clubs they are not in

**User in Multiple Clubs (5 tests)**
- ✓ Can create addresses in all assigned clubs
- ✓ Can have same address number in each club
- ✓ Cannot create addresses in unassigned clubs
- ✓ Can move addresses between their assigned clubs
- ✓ Cannot move addresses to unassigned clubs

#### Edge Cases (3 tests)
- ✓ Admin with lhUserId can manage addresses globally
- ✓ Regular user with elevated permissions still restricted by club
- ✓ Handles user removed from club mid-request

#### Middleware Chain (1 test)
- ✓ Runs permission checks in correct order

## Business Rules Tested

### 1. Per-Club Address Number Uniqueness
```
✓ Address numbers must be unique WITHIN each club
✓ The same address number CAN exist in different clubs
✓ User A has address 003 in Club 1
✓ User B cannot create 003 in Club 1 (blocked)
✓ User B can create 003 in Club 2 (allowed)
```

### 2. Authorization Hierarchy
```
✓ Admins bypass all restrictions (club membership, user ownership)
✓ Regular users can only manage their own addresses
✓ Regular users must be in a club to create/edit addresses there
✓ Non-assigned users cannot access resources
```

### 3. Multi-Club Support
```
✓ User assigned to multiple clubs can create addresses in each
✓ User can have same address number in each assigned club
✓ User cannot access unassigned clubs
✓ User can move addresses between assigned clubs
```

### 4. Data Integrity
```
✓ Idempotent updates (same number on same address succeeds)
✓ Concurrent operations handled safely by database
✓ Proper error messages for all denial scenarios
✓ Consistent HTTP status codes
```

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests in watch mode
```bash
npm test
```

### Run all tests once
```bash
npm test -- --run
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
npm test test/addresses.model.test.ts -- --run
```

### Run tests matching pattern
```bash
npm test -- --run -t "Per-Club"
```

### Generate coverage report
```bash
npm test -- --run --coverage

## Key Test Patterns

### 1. Mock Database Testing
Tests use Vitest's `vi.fn()` to mock database operations without requiring a real database connection.

```typescript
const mockSelect = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
  from: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
    where: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([/* data */]),
  }),
});
```

### 2. Authorization Testing
Each endpoint test verifies:
- Authentication requirement (checkAuth)
- Permission requirement (checkUserPermission)
- User-specific logic (non-admin restrictions)
- Club membership validation (non-admin only)

### 3. Uniqueness Constraint Testing
Tests verify that:
- Same number in same club is blocked
- Same number in different clubs is allowed
- Updates don't conflict with current address
- Cross-club moves work correctly

### 4. Error Scenario Testing
Every endpoint tests for:
- 400 Bad Request (missing fields)
- 403 Forbidden (authorization, club membership)
- 404 Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- 500 Internal Server Error (database failures)

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Integration Tests with Real Database**
   - Use test database container
   - Test actual foreign key constraints
   - Verify transaction handling

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing with concurrent requests
   - Query performance validation
   - Database index verification

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Full workflow from authentication to deletion
   - Multi-user concurrent scenarios
   - Club assignment changes during operations

4. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Very large address numbers
   - Special characters in descriptions
   - Boundary conditions for all fields

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests hanging on `npm test`
Use `npm test -- --run` to run tests without watch mode.

### Module resolution errors
These are typically from the Cloudflare Workers test environment and don't affect the address tests. Focus on the test output that shows the passed tests.

### Mock database not working
Ensure vi.fn() is properly nested for chained method calls like `.select().from().where()`.
